KEYDOWN #1
User presses up arrow (38)
38 equals the element located at `code[0]`...we increment `index` by 1 (index == 1)
1 does not equal 10...so no alert or resetting of `index`
End of function call

KEYDOWN #2
User presses up arrow (38)
38 equals the element located at `code[1]`...we increment `index` by 1 (index == 2)
2 does not equal 10...so no alert or resetting of `index`
End of function call

KEYDOWN #3
User presses down arrow (40)
40 equals the element located at `code[2]`...we increment `index` by 1 (index == 3)
3 does not equal 10...so no alert or resetting of `index`
End of function call

KEYDOWN #4
User presses down arrow (40)
40 equals the element located at `code[3]`...we increment `index` by 1 (index == 4)
4 does not equal 10...so no alert or resetting of `index`
End of function call

KEYDOWN #5
User presses left arrow (37)
37 equals the element located at `code[4]`...we increment `index` by 1 (index == 5)
5 does not equal 10...so no alert or resetting of `index`
End of function call

KEYDOWN #6
User presses right arrow (39)
39 equals the element located at `code[5]`...we increment `index` by 1 (index == 6)
6 does not equal 10...so no alert or resetting of `index`
End of function call

KEYDOWN #7
User presses left arrow (37)
37 equals the element located at `code[6]`...we increment `index` by 1 (index == 7)
7 does not equal 10...so no alert or resetting of `index`

9 does not equal 10...so no alert or resetting of `index`
End of function call

KEYDOWN #10
User presses A (65)
65 equals the element located at `code[9]`...we increment `index` by 1 (index == 10)
10 does equal 10...so alert pops up with text "Bravo!" and `index` is set to 0 (index == 0)
